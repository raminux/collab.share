# How to design a social network platform?

As you know, there are a plethora of social network platforms out there, so it is not a new concept and new idea. But, as this channel aims to teach new concepts and new skills, it is a good idea to consider a real life project for the channel and develop it along the way with the help of you. This is a collaborative channel, so I appreciate any suggestion, any contribution and collaboration to improve the channel and also the platform. The name of the platform that we're going to develop is **CollabShare**, which means that we ==collaborate== together and ==share== the platform benefits and drawbacks toghether. 

So, our destination is clear, but we have to have a good system to acheive this goal. As a result, we must focus on the process and how to do the task. This is a channel that documents our journey on developing a new type of social network platform. Until finding a good approach, we may need to try different methods and see which one is more effective. 

In this video, we want to explore the process of designing a social network platform and highlight the features that we want to implement a long the way. It must be noted that, the features and capabilities that we want to add or remove may change during the process as we go toghether and discuss toghether to reach a nice platform. So, we always have a feedback that corrects our path and our approach to reach the goal. In other words, we always try to improve little by little on a daily basis.

So let's cut to chase and start the task. 
First of all lets define a social network platform and its categorization.
