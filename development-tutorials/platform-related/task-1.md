# First Youtube Video: Outlining the scope of this Youtube Channel
Hi my friends. This is the first video in a series of videos that I want to make to show the development of a `new social network platform` based on the idea that all users are collaborators not customers of the platform. Each user can participate in the different aspects of this platform and help it to grow and get mature. Every little collaboration from users is considered and users recieve shares and benefits based on their collaborations. This is based on the fact that nature values collaboration more than competition. We are here to collaborate and grow together, not to fight and die alone. 
This channel is going to show my journey along with you to become a group of entrepruneurs from the beginning to the end. We wil learn alot from each other in this quest. 
The overall content of the channel will be about spirituality, programming, society, and life vision. These topics define the direction of the channel. I hope you enjoy, learn, and collaborate with me to grow both the channel and the platform with much greater speed. Ok, now lets see what will be going to do throught the development cycle. As you may know, developing a software platform requires a great deal of knowledge. I am not a computer guru or have an academic knowledge in this topic, I have learned different concepts and technologies by myself, but still there is lot to learn. We will start developing this platform based on my current knowledge and we'll learn new materials together as we go along this fantastic journey. 

The main goal of this channel is to show every detail of creating a new startup. Along the way, we are going to learn alot. So, the main content of the channel will relate to the platfor, development. But, in order to increase the audience of the channel, I will make standalone videos about specific problem that every programmer may encounter in their entire career. So, we have two main categories of videos as:
1. Platform development training
2. General training

This categorization is necessary because developing a platform involves many trial and error phases. General audience may need to get help on some specific area, and following all the platform development codes may not be possible for them. In this regard, it is a good idea to produce videos that answer specific programming and developing problems. 

## Benefit distribution
An important point that makes this channel distinct from other ones is that every contribution by users to this channel is also be valued and will be considered for benefit sharing so that when the channel reaches monetization, I will distribute it among the collaborators based on their contribution. This is a really teamwork and fair environment and I open to suggestion and any improvement of the channel. In this regard, statistics of the channel in terms of user collaboration will be displayed on every video of the channel. Statistics such as number of collaborators, number of likes, overall watch time, ... The type of statistics will be improved over time. 

To track the contribution of collaborators effectively, we must design a machanism to take into account every contribution. To achieve this, I'm going to design a framework to take into account the users collaboration in social network platforms in order to increase the effectiveness of this new platform. 


> Important point: As this channel aims to show the challenges of developing a platform, every detail of this process will be documented. 

## Quality of Videos
To help channel grow rapidly, I try to make high quality videos with useful content. This channel will help you to grow step by step. Keep in mind that success is not an event, it is a process, and consistency is the key part of this process. 

## Technologies Used
As you know, there are a plethora of ptogramming languages and various kind of frameworks to develop an application. Here, we will use Django for backend development. Specifically, we will use test-driven django to develop our platform. Test-driven development (TDD) may decrease the overall speed of programming but in the long run, it makes life easier. I will talk about TDD in seperate videos. 
For the frontend, we must take into account different platforms, I mean web, android, ios, windows, linux. Our platform must run on each of those with ease and good compatibility. There are two main choices to achieve this goal, Flutter and React/React Native. Each of them has their own benefits and drawbacks. We will discuss about it and choose one of them to go. More details on technologies used to design the platform will be given along the way. 

##  A little bit more on the Philosophy of this platform
Let's assume a world that values human efforts permanently! For example, consider a freelancing platform, where people help each other to solve their problems and projects and recieve money for it. In this platform, there are generally three kinds of individuals who recieves benefits:

1. Platform developers (owners)
2. Freelancers
3. Project submitters

Project submitter gives money to the platform developer to find a freelancer to solve their problems. Platform developer takes some portion of money and gives the rest to the freelancer for solving the project. 

In this context, all contributors' efforts to the platform must be sumed up. Efforts are counted in terms of collabs.
For example, the platform developer recieves 10 collabs for its provided value in this scenario. The freelancer recieves 1 or 2 or ... collabs based on the difficulty of the project. Finally, the project submitter recieves 1 collabs for his/her effort. In other words, every effort is measured in terms of collab. The unit of effort is collab. One collab is the amount of effort each person put into the platform to make it better. Exact definition of one collab requires more discussion and thinking. 

Another example would be an online advertising company. In this setting, there are four types of individuals who recieves benefits:
1. Platform developer and maintainer (owner)
2. Advetiser
3. Content provider (such as a learning video on Django)
4. Target user (who sees the content and the advertisement)

In this context, every one must recieve some collabs based on their effort and effectiveness of their actions to the platform. 

The important thing that I want to highlight is that we can share benefits among collaborators to increase the happiness and well-being on earth for every one. We are not here to work all day long to just be alive, we are here to live life to its fullest potential. We must collaborate not compete with each other. We are all the same with different capabilities that can be complemented by each other.
