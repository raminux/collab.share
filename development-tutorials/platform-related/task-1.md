# First Youtube Video: Outlining the scope of this Youtube Channel
Hi my friends. This is the first video in a series of videos that I want to make to show the development a `new social network platform` based on the idea that all users are collaborators not customers of the platform. Each user can participate in the different aspects of this platform and help it to grow and get mature. Every little collaboration from users is considered and users recieve shares and benefits based on their collaborations. This is based on the fact that nature values collaboration more than competition. We are here to collaborate and grow together, not to fight and die alone. 
This channel is going to show my journey along with you to become a group of entrepruneurs from the beginning to the end. We wil learn alot from each other. 
The overall content of the channel will be about spirituality, programming, society, and life vision. These topics define the direction of the channel. I hope you will enjoy, learn, and collaborate with me to grow both the channel and the platform with much greater speed. Ok, now lets see what will be going on throught the development cycle. As you may know, developing a software platform requires a great deal of knowledge. I am not a computer guru or have an academic knowledge in this topic, I have learned different concepts and technologies by myself, but still there is lot to learn. We will start developing this platform based on my current knowledge and we'll learn new materials together as we go along this fantastic journey.
