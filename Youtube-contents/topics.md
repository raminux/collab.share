# Youtube Channel Topics

In this channel, I'm goin to develop different applications for the following purposes:
- Habit formation and Tracker
- Spirituality increase
- Life visioning
- ... to be completed 

In this platform, WE WILL DESIGN an spiritual center for the purpose of increased awareness and consciousness of the collaborators.
We design various web and mobile applications on the basis of one platform. We are great collaborators. We design softwares to enhance our body and mind. For example, we can design a software for suggesting various Yoga routines based on the characterisitics of the collaborators. Every part of the platform is based on some aspect of life. Also, I'm thinking of designing a lifebook application. This application not only teaches us how to be a better person in various aspects of our lives but also helps us by suggesting various techniques and methods to actually be a better version of ourselves every moment of day. 

> Also, I will talk about quantom physics and spirituality lessons from various great spiritual teachers mostly ==Rumi==.


# Social Collaboration Platform
?

# Let's begin with myself
What am I going to bring to the world that benefits all?
What are may capabilities to help people in their lives?
What can I do for the society?
What product should I make?
I want to create a new social platform. How should I start? 
What service should I bring to the world?
Be specific and concentrate on it!
1. Help people in the apply process
2. Start a new social platform with user contribution in mind. 
3. Start any new website with user contribution in mind.

I start my own social platform with user contribution in my mind and my codes.
The core of this platform is to give value to each user contribution and give them money based on their collaboration to the platform. 
In this regard, I have to develop a Model for collaboration. First of all, I have to define various kinds of collaboration. Then devise a model for them based on Django syntax. 

So the core of this platform is collaboration evaluation. let's define various types of collaboration and design a model for them
- Like/don't like
- Star (How much do you like? It can be negative, positive, and zero)
- Follow/unfollow
- View
- Share
- Content Creation (Video, Image, Text, Sound, Physical objects)
- Comment
- Suggestion
- Project definition (like freelancing websites)
- Project Solver
- Advertisement Creator
- Advertisee (Who asks us to advertise their products)
- Advertising identifier (معرف تبلیغات)
- Developer
- Supporter (Ticketing)
- Financial Suppporter
- 

Each of those areas need a seperate Table. Now, let's define various Tables for those areas. This is how the project starts. Start immediately not let it happen in near future. In other words, don't postpone your works. Do them right now. 

So, my next movement will be designing those entities and Coding them in Django Just for fun and test the idea. 

Also, we have to keep in mind that how to evaluate each type of collaboration?

> An inportant point to keep in mind is that collaboration must not lead to competition. So, we encourage gaving groups together and create content, solve problems, and many more together. So gaving groups and working in the groups has more collaboration point than just working alone. 

> The minimum amount of collaboration defines the base value for collaborations. I think this would be liking/unliking. The minimum amount of value is named ==***collabshare***==. 


> I have to remember that I want to create this platform to help every one to earn money based on their efforts and contribution to the platform. This can help various categories of people to use their experience and knowledge in a friendly and reliable manner to earn money for their living and beyond. This is the main goal of this platform to enable every one to be wealthy!
