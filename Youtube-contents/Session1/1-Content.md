## 1.  Overall aim of the channel
Hi my friends. 
Welcome to collaboration.share channel. It's our pleasure to have you with us and please subscribe and contribute to the channel. We're open to hear from you and learn from you. So, please like our videos if you're really interested in them, comment your opinions, ideas, and also share our videos with your friends. Thanks.
This is the first video in a series of videos that we want to make to show the development of a `new social network platform` based on the idea that all users are collaborators not customers of the platform. In other words, every individual who participates in the platform is a potential collaborator, not potential customer of the platform. Each user can participate in the different aspects of this platform and help it to grow and get mature. Every little collaboration from users is considered and users recieve shares and benefits based on their collaborations. This is based on the fact that nature values collaboration more than competition. We are here to collaborate and grow together, not to fight and die alone. 
In this channel, we're going to develop a big social network platform from the beginning to the end, and obviously, we'll face many challenges and interesting problems to solve together. ==&rarr;(Next Slide)== As you know, social network platforms are currently every where and I've been always fascinated about this technology. I'm highly encouraged to develop a huge social platform to grasp the core concepts involved in this technology. As as enthusiastic software developer, I would like to see how theory and practice link together. So, I've chosen this big software project to understand various aspects of software design and engineering. In fact, we have a clear intention in this channel, developing a social network platform from the beginning to the end. In addition to the science and engineering, I see many programmers and developers that are also interested in art. Of course, poetry, painting, and drawing are three of the important branches of art. I love poetry and it's connection to human mind and heart. I love drawing because it helps me to calm down and be mindful. We aim to develop a social network platform and at the same time learn about the creativity involved in poetries and drawing and painting. In conclusion, in this channel, we'll talk about sotfware development and art and their relationships, and as we go furthur in this road, we'll see how these branches of science and art can help us to shape our inner and outer world in a good way. This is fascinating!
As you can see, from the beginning of this tutorial, I was using Dall E 2, to describe various concepts. Dalle2 is an AI tool to generate Pictures and paintings from text. This is one of the example of how science and art collaborate to amaze us!

## 2. What is a social network platform?
As it is stated in **wikipedia.org**, social networking service (site) is an online platform which people use to build social networks or social relationships with other people who share similar personal or career content, interests, activities, backgrounds, or real-life connections. It is clear that in this definition, people share many things but the platform. The platform is for others that do not want to share it with people. This is where the problem arises. Here, we address this issue and design a new platform to enable real sharing. 

### 2.1 Types of Social Media Apps
There are 5 major types of social media platforms, namely:
1. Social networks 
The aim of this platforms is to let you connect with people, but they use different approaches to acheive it. For example, the Facebook connects friends and families toghether. On the other hand, the Linkedin connects professionals around the globe. 

2. Media Sharing Networks
These platforms have been used so far for uploading and sharing media, written content, comment posts, post content on other social media apps. Examples of this category would be Instagram and Snapchat.

3. Social Media Blogs
We may put youtube, pinterest, and twitter in this category. We can use thier tools to push content online. 

4. Community and discussion forums
In this platforms, users share their opinions about various topics, Examples included Reddit, and Quora. 

5. Consumer Reviews Networks
These types of platforms allow customers to read online reviews about an specific product before purchasing it. For example, tripadviser, and yelp are two of them.

## 3. What technologies are we going to use?
As you know, there are a plethora of programming languages and various kind of frameworks to develop an application. Here, we will use Django for backend development. Specifically, we will use test-driven django to develop our platform. Test-driven development (TDD) may decrease the overall speed of programming but in the long run, it makes life easier. I will talk about TDD in seperate videos. 
For the frontend, we must take into account different platforms, I mean web, android, ios, windows, linux. Our platform must run on each of those with ease and good compatibility. There are two main choices to achieve this goal, Flutter and React/React Native. Each of them has their own benefits and drawbacks. We will discuss about it and choose one of them to go. More details on technologies used to design the platform will be given along the way.

### 3.1 What is Django?
### 3.2 What is a virtual Env?
### 3.3 What is Python?

Django is a web framework that helps developers to bring their ideas into practice without worrying about every details of development. As we go along the way, we will see how powerful is this framework and how easy to understand its concepts and modify them accordingly. Django is a modular framework, I mean it enables you to develop various parts of the projects in something called app, that can be used in other projects. We will go into much more detail in upcomig videos. So, let's install Django and start our Soical Network Platform Project. To do so, we must make sure that we have all the requirements of Django. Let's check it within the Django website:


vscode
python --version
pipenv sehll
python -m pip install django



## 4. One of Rumi's poems + Digital Art

“Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself.”
