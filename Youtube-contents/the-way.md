# The Way
This is a new idea that has been recently come to my mind. The core of which is to show the way to reach an specific goal. It should be noted that **the way** is the starting point of ==the CollabShare== platform. As the name of the idea suggests, we want to show the way to the user in a collaborative manner. At the beginning, we have to model the platform in a useful and graphical manner. Also, we must provide various diagrams to different ways to goals. In other words, we must answer some important questions graphically. 

There are two parts for this platform. One part is the VIP part. The other one is the normal one. In the VIP section, each question that is asked by users will be processed immediately by the platform collaborators. In other words, collaborators must provide a valid graph and also it's related video and resources on how to solve the user's problem or question. On the other hand, by normal one, problems and questions asked by users will be put in a request pool and will be processed by voluntarily by collaborators. 

> In this platform, *users* are those who asks a question or defines a problem to be solved, and *collaborators* are those who has been solved at least one problem. However, I think it's better to rename the *users* and find an appropriate name for them. For example, *collaborator-stage-1* for those who are at the beginning of their way in this platform. And *collaborator-stage-n* for those who has contributed continuously to the platform. 

> There may be different approaches to solve a problem, so there may be various graphs for each question or problem.
