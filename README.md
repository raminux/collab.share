# collab.share

The aim of this repo is to design a new kind of social network platform. It provides a unique collaborative environment for its users. The main feature of it is that every contribution of users will be valued. This is the core of this platform. 

## What to do now?
At this point, I have to start small. First of all, I must design the pages of this platform. It should contain the following elements:

- [ ] Objective (start small) 
    - [ ] I'm going to teach how to improve the platform
        - [ ] General tutorials useful for various purposes
        - [ ] Specific tutorials relating to platform development
        - [ ] General trainings are just in the direction of platform development.
    - [ ] get feedback and participate users in the flow
    - [ ] make it fun and helpful
    - [ ] This section has a webpage called `Platform Development Guidelines`
        - [ ] Shows all viedos
        - [ ] loads videos from youtube
        - [ ] shows comments
        - [ ] shows likes
        - [ ] shows youtube statistics of this video
        - [ ] takes into account UX/UI
    
- [ ] User registration procedures
    - [ ] sign up, sign in, log out, 
    - [ ] authenticate using github and gmail

- [ ] User profile
    - [ ] show user's share
    - [ ] show user's collaborations

- [ ] Collaboration
    - [ ] different types of collaboration
    - [ ] start small
    - [ ] follow/unfollow
    - [ ] fuzzy like/dislike
    - [ ] add comments
    - [ ] score comments
    - [ ] suggestions
    - [ ] voice/video tutoring

- [ ] Landing page
    - [ ] show the last videos of the platform
    - [ ] show some statistics


## Some basic guidelines for developers
- The target is clear, go in that direction on a daily basis.
- Learn and teach whatever is required along the way. Just be on the way!
- Persist!
- Consistency is the key.
- Do something every day even though it seems small. Small improvements will result in a huge progress!

## Redefining Goals
As I stated before, start small and grow bigger. This is what everything in the nature is based on. So, I've decided to start this channel as a ==Coding & Poetry== platform. As a result, I'm going to develope a collaborative platform and talk about poem. That's it!
Simple yet effective and my favorite!
